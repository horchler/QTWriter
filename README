QTWriter
   Version 1.0, 4-30-12
   
   OBJ = QTWriter(FILENAME) constructs a QTWriter object to write QuickTime
   movie data to a '.mov' file that using lossless Photo PNG compression.
   FILENAME is a string enclosed in single quotation marks that specifies
   the name of the file to create. If filename does not include an
   extension the QTWriter constructor appends the '.mov' extension. The
   FILENAME can include an absolute or relative path.
   
   OBJ = QTWriter(...,'PropertyName','PropertyValue',...) specifies options
   via property name-value pairs. The lossy Photo JPEG format can be
   specified via the 'MovieFormat' property. The 'Quality' property
   indicates the level of lossy compression to use. THe 'ColosSpace'
   property specifies if the movie is to be output as 24-bit RGB truecolor
   or 8-bit grayscale. The 'Transparency' property indicates if the movie
   is to be output with an alpha channel (Photo PNG format only).
   
   Frames are written via the writeMovie(FRAME) method of the QTWriter
   object. The frame rate of the movie can be continuously varied via the
   'FrameRate' property o the QTWriter object. The looping behavior of the
   output movie can be specified via the 'Loop' property of the QTWriter
   object - 'none', 'loop', or 'backandforth'. Finally, the output movie
   can be forced to play every frame via the 'PlayAllFrames' property of
   the QTWriter object. The close method of the QTWriter object is called
   to finish writing the movie and clean up assosciated data.
   
   QTWriter is inspired by MakeQTMovie by Malcolm Slaney (Interval
   Research, March 1999) and parts are based on the VideoWriter class in
   Matlab R2011b.
